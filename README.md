# StarWars
## App for browsing starwars characters

I used react-native-paper for search bar and table
Redux for state management and AsyncStorage to save liked characters
RTK Query to get data from api

Also I added images from another api [](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akabab/starwars-api/0.2.1/api/id/2.json)
